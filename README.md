# Premier University Contest Solutions

Welcome to the **Premier University Contest Solutions** repository! This repository contains the solutions to various problems from contests held at Premier University. These problems cover a wide range of topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and are aimed at helping students improve their problem-solving skills.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving problems from the Premier University contests. The solutions provided here are written in **C++** and demonstrate various algorithmic approaches and problem-solving techniques.

## Problem Categories

The problems in this repository are organized into various categories to help you better understand different types of problems and how to approach them:

- **Arrays**: Problems involving arrays and their manipulation.
- **Strings**: String manipulation problems, pattern matching, etc.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Problems focused on different sorting algorithms and search techniques.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Problems involving graph theory, such as traversal and pathfinding.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions based on optimizing problems through dynamic programming.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems that require making locally optimal choices at each step.
- **Backtracking**: Problems that involve exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when necessary.
- **Other Topics**: Miscellaneous problems that donâ€™t fit into the above categories but are equally important.

## Languages Used

The solutions are primarily written in **C++**, utilizing its rich Standard Template Library (STL) for optimal performance in problem-solving.

## Example Problem Solutions

Here are a few example problems and their corresponding solutions available in this repository:

- **Problem 1**: [Find the Largest Element in an Array](./arrays/largest_element.cpp)
- **Problem 2**: [Check if a String is a Palindrome](./strings/palindrome_check.cpp)
- **Problem 3**: [Binary Search in a Sorted Array](./sorting_and_searching/binary_search.cpp)
- **Problem 4**: [Depth-First Search in a Graph](./graphs/dfs.cpp)
- **Problem 5**: [Fibonacci Sequence Using Dynamic Programming](./dynamic_programming/fibonacci.cpp)
